Project Name: Gold House

My Name: Cindy Li

Year: I'm not really sure but I think I'm considered a senior.

I decided to choose to do something I'm comfortable with, creating a webpage using HTML. I work in a restaurant, hence the project name: Gold House and wanted to create a webpage for it. I never uploaded a html file to GitHub before so I'm not sure how this will work.

When I did tried it myself, I downloaded the repositories via ZIP. I extract the folder and it worked 
fine. I think you should mainly open the index.html using your browser because that's the front page
of the website. You won't need to open the .html file one by one. As long as you have the folder on your computer, the webpage should work fine.
