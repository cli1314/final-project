# final-project

Project Name: Gold House

My Name: Cindy Li

Year: I'm not really sure but I think I'm considered a senior.

I decided to choose to do something I'm comfortable with, creating a webpage using HTML. I work in a restaurant, hence the project name: Gold House and wanted to create a webpage for it. I never uploaded a html file to GitHub before so I'm not sure how this will work. I download the repositories via zip and tried opening the .html in my browser but it doesnâ€™t work or look like when I opened it directly but it still look kind of alright~ At least the information and code is still there.
